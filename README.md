# 🧠 YieldCraft
**YieldCraft** is a smart contract-based automated yield farming optimizer that intelligently reallocates deposited funds across multiple DeFi protocols to maximize yield. Designed to be modular and extensible, it enables users to earn optimized returns on stablecoin deposits without managing strategies manually.

### 📌 Overview
In DeFi, different protocols offer varying returns for the same asset (e.g., USDC). Manually chasing the best yield is inefficient. YieldCraft solves this by:
- Accepting deposits in a stablecoin
- Monitoring yield (APY) from multiple supported protocols
- Moving funds into the protocol offering the best returns
- Allowing users to withdraw at any time

### 🧠 Core Concept
- User deposits: Anyone can deposit stablecoins into the YieldCraft contract.
- Yield allocation: Funds are routed to supported protocols based on real-time or recent APY data.
- Strategist or automation: A designated strategist (or service like Chainlink Automation) can trigger rebalancing.
- Withdrawals: Users withdraw their deposits, and the contract redeems proportional liquidity from the underlying protocols.

### ⚙️ How It Works
- Add Protocols: Admins can register protocols to be used (e.g., Aave, Compound).
- Deposit Funds: Users deposit stablecoins into the contract.
- Rebalance Funds: The strategist evaluates APYs and moves all funds to the best option.
- Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw anytime, regardless of current allocation.

### 🌟 Features
✅ Automated yield optimization<br>
🔁 Manual or automated rebalancing<br>
📦 Modular protocol support via adapters<br>
🔐 Non-custodial design (users can withdraw anytime)<br>
🧩 Easily extendable for new protocols

### 🧱 Architecture Overview
- YieldCraft Contract: Manages deposits, rebalancing, and protocol allocation.
- Protocol Interface: All supported protocols must implement a shared interface (deposit, withdraw, getAPY).
- Strategist Role: A special role (or automation bot) that executes rebalances.
- Adapters: Modular connectors that translate YieldCraft logic into specific protocol actions.

### 🧪 Example Use Cases
- DeFi power users who want to maximize returns without switching platforms manually.
- Stablecoin treasuries looking for low-risk yield farming strategies.
- DAOs or protocols managing idle funds with automated strategy layers.

### 🔐 Security Considerations
- Role access must be strictly enforced (owner, strategist).
- APY inputs must be validated to avoid manipulation.
- Reentrancy protection and other standard Solidity practices are required.
- Oracle integration (if added) must be robust and trusted.

### 🛠 Future Improvements
- Integration with live APY oracles (e.g., Chainlink).
- Full support for ERC4626 vault standard.
- Frontend UI for deposits, balances, and protocol views.
- Performance fee and incentive structure for strategists.
- DAO governance model for protocol management.
